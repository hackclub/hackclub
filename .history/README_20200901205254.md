[**Hack Club**](https://hackclub.com/) is a global, nonprofit network of high school makers & student-led coding clubs. This repository is where we store our [Workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com), which are self-led learn-to-code tutorials, as well as our [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct/).

## Philosophy

We think learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it converts you from a _consumer_ to a _creator_, turning your computer into a tool for creation. If you’re reading this, you can learn to build an app—there’s never been a better time for making.

**The goal of Hack Club is to help you become a hacker.** We want an inclusive space on the internet & at every school where people are making interesting things with code, every week. In our [online Slack](https://slack.hackclub.com) (Discord-style online chatroom with 9K student members), you can ask coding questions, you’ll meet amazing friends, share projects you’re building, and so much more. Most members start out with little to no coding experience, join our Slack, build projects of their own, [start clubs](https://hackclub.com/clubs/) at their school, attend & later organize [hackathons](https://hackathons.hackclub.com).

Hack Club was founded by [a teenager](https://zachlatta.com) who dropped out of high school because the school system wasn’t working. We’re an entirely open source organization—[our website](https://github.com/hackclub/v3) to even [our finances](https://bank.hackclub.com/hq) are public. It’s backed by everyone from [Elon Musk](https://hackclub.com/elon/) to GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner.

## Contributing to our [Workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com/)

Contributions are welcome!

If you need any help, please contact us at team@hackclub.com or on our [Slack](https://slack.hackclub.com/).

1. Check out our [public issues board][0]. If your issue isn't on the board, [open a new one][1].
2. Pick an issue that nobody has claimed and start working on it. First time contributors should look for the "[first-timers-only][2]" label on issues.
3. Fork the project ([Need help forking a project?][3]). You’ll do all of your work on your forked copy.
4. Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work on that branch ([Need help with branching?][4]).
5. Name the branch something like `fixes-xxx-issue` or `add-xxx-feature` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are adding.
6. Once your code is ready, submit a pull request from your branch to Hack Club's `main` branch. We'll do a quick review and give you feedback.

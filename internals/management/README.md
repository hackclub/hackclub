## Goals

[**Long-term, 5 year goals**](long_term.md)

---

We use **objectives** and **key results** to set goals at Hack Club. We operate on the regular business year:

- **Q1**: January - March
- **Q2**: April - June
- **Q3**: July - September
- **Q4**: October - December

We set OKRs quartlerly. Here are our current OKRs for Q3 2017:

**Increase number of clubs**

- Have 300 clubs
- Receive 500 legitimate applications

**Increase quality of clubs**

- Record one project shipped per club member (averaged over all clubs)
- Record the reason for every club death

**Increase leader happiness**

- _Slack activity increase (pending on Max, will have this by 2017-07-16)_
- _NPS (pending on Max, will have this by 2017-07-16)_

## Managing Work

Work is broken down into work-specific, sprint-like _projects_ to accomplish key results. Each project has a corresponding [organization-wide GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects) and an associated deadline.

Projects should ideally exist for no longer than 30 days and cannot contain subprojects. Once a project's deadline is passed, it should be closed (not deleted). Long-term projects should be broken down into more managable chunks.

[The main GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects/2) tracks the progress of projects.

Hack Club helps high schoolers start coding clubs

**What will your organization do?**

Hack Club helps high schoolers start after-school coding clubs. We provide everything high schoolers need to start an awesome clubs: content for club meetings, leadership training, our club community, and partnerships with events.

Our clubs have gone on to host hackathons with hundreds of participants, bring coding education to traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities, and build some pretty awesome projects (check out http://mhacksv.devpost.com/submissions/31699-datawave).

SSHTron is a multiplayer Tron game over SSH. It's a fun little hack I made at a hackathon. 11,500 people (uniques) played the game within a week of its launch. Source: https://github.com/zachlatta/sshtron

**How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?**

N/A

### Progress

**How far along are you?**

I've been working on Hack Club for a year and a half. We've grown to 83 schools in 16 states and 7 countries (just started one in Pakistan), reaching over 1,500 students.

**If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?**

N/A

**Which of the following best describes your progress?**

Launched

**How many users do you have?**

1500

**Do you have revenue?**

Yes

**How much revenue?**

\$165,765.00

**What is your monthly growth rate?**

(in users or revenue or both)

We're growing our number of clubs by 13% monthly.

**If you've applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you made since the last time you applied? Anything change?**

We nearly doubled in size (47 -> 83 schools) and secured another \$75,000 grant. We made significant progress on our club materials, adding minute-by-minute guidelines for meetings and additional guidance on how to structure clubs.

**If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.**

We haven't.

### Idea

**Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know this is going to work?**

When I was in high school, I started a coding club to build the hacker community I wished existed. But it wasn't without its issues: we lacked curriculum, we didn't know how to create a good environment for hacking, and we weren't a part of something larger than our school. After meeting other high schoolers who also started clubs, but ran into the exact same issues, I decided to start Hack Club.

I think this is going to work because our clubs are succeeding and the people starting clubs without us are failing for the same three reasons: they lack curriculum suited for a club, they're not sure how to create an environment that facilitates hacking, and they lack a community supporting what they do bigger than their school.

**What's new about what you plan to do?**

Our clubs and content are built by students, for students.

By having high schoolers lead clubs, we're able to bypass the red tape typically associated with bringing computer science to a school or a community. Whereas it can take years to start a new computer science program, starting a Hack Club can take as little as two weeks. Our leaders don't need to find their own space (the school is their space), recruit external volunteers (their friends are volunteers), or hire teachers (they teach using our pre-written workshops). This model makes the cost of starting a new club virtually \$0 from our end and we think it'll let us scale where others haven't.

### Formation

**Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?**

Yes

**What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed? (e.g. Delaware C Corp)**

Non-stock non-profit corporation

**If you're already incorporated, when were you? If you've had funding, how much and from whom?**

January 2014. We've secured \$165,765.00 in donations from The Reva & David Logan Foundation, the Thiel Foundation, Joe Lonsdale, and other individual supporters.

**Have you obtained your 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status yet?**

Yes

**Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or formation of the company.**

We're fiscally sponsored by Mission Bit (https://www.missionbit.com/).

### Others

**If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for.**

**Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.**

(The answer need not be related to your project.)

Edwin Grozier bought The Boston Post in 1891 and, within two decades, grew it from 3,000 daily readers to 300,000 – making it easily the largest paper in Boston and New England.

How did he do it? He pulled a Buzzfeed. His plan was to do a bunch of viral stunts to get readers, with those readers—and therefore revenue—hire quality journalists, and then produce quality content to keep the readers coming back. It worked exceptionally well -- The Boston Post later became the first paper in Boston to win a Pulitzer Prize.

One of their stunts was to send someone from the paper with $100 in cash ($1000 in today's dollar) to an arbitrary district of Boston. In that morning's Post, they'd print that they sent someone to a certain district of Boston and the first person to ask them if they read the Post that morning would get the \$100 on the spot. Throughout the day, everyone in the selected district of the city would be asking strangers if they read the Post that morning.

**Project Title**

hackEDU

**Summarize your idea in one sentence**

We help with high school students to start student-run computer programming
clubs.

**What are you proposing to do?**

1 million programming jobs will be unfilled by 2020 and only 1/4 high schools
offer programming classes.

We help high school students to start programming clubs by providing them with a
guide and supportive community. We engage these club leaders to not only create
spaces at their schools where students learn to code, but also to start their
own hackathons and sometimes even companies.

It's hard to create programming talent and even harder to retain. Our easy to
start coding clubs create a continuous pipeline of programming talent, that if
successful, lives on indefinitely in a city's high schools.

**Why is this the right idea for this city now?**

In the past, any programmers would leave Philadelphia and Detroit to find work.
That's changing.

These two cities are home to the two first and largest collegiate hackathons
in the world, held at the University of Michigan and University of
Pennsylvania, respectively. These hackathons inspired the creation of many
other collegiate hackathons which grew the number of collegiate hackathon
participants from 500 attendees in 2011 to 50,000 in 2016.

These hackathons garner the attention of top schools and companies across the
world and create tech ecosystems that did not exist 4 years ago. High school
is the next step.

**Who will execute this project**:

There are 4 parts to the work that we do: technology, community, and curriculum
and our team has experts in all 3.

Zach Latta, lead the engineering team at a Silicon Valley startup with millions
of users and 1.5 million in funding when he was 16.

Dave Fontenot created the largest community of hackers in the world. It has an
online presence of over 18,000 members.

Jonathan Leung has over 4 years of curriculum design and teaching experience in
coding.

Dave also started Michigan's Hackathon and Jonathan lead UPenn's hackathon
(mentioned in the previous question).

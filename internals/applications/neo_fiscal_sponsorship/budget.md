Note: these balances do not include any income or expenses from before January 1st, 2016. This may make some balances confusing, like in the case of `Liabilities:Reimbursement:Jonathan Leung`. To clarify, that means we reimbursed Jonathan \$3,014.90 more than what he recorded for reimbursements in 2016. In this case, that's because we paid out all of his 2015 and 2016 reimbursements in a lump sum.

## All Time Balances

This includes all income, expenses, and recorded assets as of May 1st, 2016.

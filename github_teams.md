# GitHub Teams

So the way we manage teams isn't too complicated. It all comes down to the
following bullet points:

- One GitHub team per GitHub repo with write acess to the repo (ex. if the
  repository is called `hack-camp`, the team will be called `hack-camp`)
- Anyone who we want to add to that repository as a collaborator is added to the
  GitHub team for that repo.

We'll also have occasional GitHub teams to give permissions to larger groups,
like club leaders or staff. Those will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

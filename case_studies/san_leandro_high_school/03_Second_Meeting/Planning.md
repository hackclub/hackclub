# Planning

## Plans for Event

1. One of our members wants to do a presentation to bring humor to the club
2. Have everyone sign in through [google forms](http://signin.hacklcubslhs.com), also include survey
3. Do a lecture on the basics of programming 
  * We had a debate on whether it is better to have a lecture or workshop, I stand on the workshop side. However everyone else is standing on having a lecture.
  * Attached below is the preparation done by the ones standing on doing it lecture style. ![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/59a2f97fb73dce96a377ead9b595e10c.png "Lecture presentation preparation")
4. If members start to get bored, we will move on to one of the [workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio)
5. Give out a survey to see how members responded to having lectures during club, and other feedback.
6. End with Hack Cheer

## Anticipated problems

* Members may get bored from listening to me lecture
* Not a lot of members filling out survey at the end
  *Prevent this by having a dedicated time for members to fill out the survey.

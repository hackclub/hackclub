# Recap

1. Before the meeting started I decided to tell one of my co-leader to go buy a
   box of pasta and marshmallows for our energizer.
2. Members came in and had them sign in at
   [signin.hackclubslhs.com](http://signin.hackclubslhs.com).
3. I introduced the new workshop,
   [soccer](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/workshops/soccer).
4. For the one that are still on [agar.io](http://agar.io) I introduced to them
   the
   [Ajar workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/workshops/contrib/ajar).
5. Half way through the meeting I got everyone together and told them to build
   a tower using marshmallow, pasta, and tape. The rule was The tower have to be
   touching the table, and marshmallow is not allow to be touching anything
   except pasta.
6. Designs that members use are surprisingly similar to designs at Hack Camp
   ![marshmallow on ceiling](http://i.imgur.com/Kexfo4M.jpg).
7. We will definitely do another energizer as members had lots of fun.
8. Continue workshop until 20 minute before the end of meeting, then I will tell
   them to submit a feedback at
   [feedback.hackclubslhs.com](http://feedback.hackclubslhs.com).

## What Didn't Go Well

- I forgot to do the Hack Cheer.
- I forgot to buy masking tape, so we sorta "took" some from the people that
  were putting up posters.

## What Went Well

- The energizer got everyone doing something that doesn't involve members sitting
  on the computer, many of them wanted to do it again.

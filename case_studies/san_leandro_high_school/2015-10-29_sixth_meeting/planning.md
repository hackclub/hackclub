# Planning

1. Everyone is going to fill out the sign in form.
2. Give them a short demo of what soccer is.
3. Send them on their way to do the soccer workshop.
4. If some members get bored challenge them to create a more complex game.
5. Tell them to fill out the feedback form at
   [feedback.hackclubslhs.com](http://feedback.hackclubslhs.com).
6. Bring out some more of the swag/goodies sent to us by our sponsor.
7. Hack Cheer!

## Anticipated Problem

- Members may go onto [agar.io](https://agar.io)
- Members may not finish their project.

# Recap

1. As expected there is little members showing up at this meeting.
2. The low amount of members worked out well as it allowed me to have more
   personal chats with the members.
3. Most members want to make a game which Dodge is an attractive workshop for
   them.
4. Bring out a box of swags/goodies got everyone together and talking. Most of
   them were talking about the NFC tag gave them.
5. I decided to show off some Android development as a member asked for it. It
   seems that they try to connect the new things they learn to concepts that
   they have learned.

## What Didn't Go Well

- A lot of member didn't show up, we are thinking of sending email to remind
  them next week.

## What Went Well

- The way I didn't plan much for this meeting allow our schedule to be more
  flexible, people worked on different things, up to their liking.

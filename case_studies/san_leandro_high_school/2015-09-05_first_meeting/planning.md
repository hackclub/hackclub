# Planning

## Plans for event

1. At the entrance we will wave our logo wildly to make sure members see us, as
   we are located in a less known part of school.
2. Start off by giving the same speech given at
   [hack camp](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/blob/master/cohort_4/playbook/ACTIVITIES.md#introduction-talk)
3. Give wifi password
4. Fill out survey, so we can invite them to slack
5. Send them on their way to create their own website with this
   [guide](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio)
   from hack camp.
6. Do an activity where we can all get to know each other.
7. Do the hack cheer!

## Anticipated problems

- Lack of directors to peer ratio, as 3/5 of our directors are doing sports the
  beginning 30min
- Technical difficulty with the projector system

# After Meeting on 10/29/15

## What Went Well?

The competition planning went very well because the members actually got into
smaller groups and discussed ideas for their project proposals. For example, one
member wanted to create an application like Google Maps but just for the school
so parents have an easier time getting around the school during events like
parent-teacher conferences.

## What Didn't Go Well?

Since many students forgot to bring in their laptops, we were not able to do
the landing page activity with them and instead did https://projecteuler.net
problems with them. This back-up activity could've gone better if we provided
them with a little easier questions that did not require code to solve. Next
time, we will give AMC/AIME questions. As a result, we told them to bring in
their laptops next time with Android Studio and a GitHub account so we could
not only educate them on how to create a simple app and share code but also get
feedback about club meetings on the labs website.

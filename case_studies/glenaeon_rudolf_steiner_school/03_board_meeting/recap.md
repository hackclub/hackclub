# The Meeting

In Australia we don't have the "Club Culture" that exists within America. For
us, attending a club is the exception, not the rule. Thus, it has taken a bit
more work than orginally anticipated to get our club set up.

## The Proposal

One of the things I was asked to do was write a short proposal for our club.

> # Club Proposal
>
> We would like to start a student run code club within the school. It would meet
> every Wednesday afternoon from 3:30-4:30 in the library. Ideally we would get
> Chris to supervise the meetings. We would roughly follow the hackEDU
> (http://hackedu.us) curriculum, a curriculum designed to quickly introduce
> programming in a project oriented manner. I (Harrison) would manage the
> workshops and ensure that each member is having their needs catered to. To make
> sure each member has a workspace we would need access to the school computers.
> However, as each of the workshops is able to be ran using online software, we
> would not need any extra software installed on them.

> The code club would be a place for students to come from all years and learn to
> build, learn and connect with their newfound programming knowledge.
>
> Thanks,
>
> Harrison, Rafe and Sam

This went down well and managed to help us gain some traction within the
community. I have had teachers telling me that "There is such a demand for
this!". One of the issues we have, is that another the "Digital Design" teacher
is starting another programming club. This club appears to be ran during lunch
times, and provide single linear lessons aimed at beginners. I'm looking
forward to dropping in on a few meetings to see what I can learn from their
structure.

## The Meeting

The meeting went well. We seem to have gotten approved, so I am going to run
our first club meeting next week.

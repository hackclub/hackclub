# First Meet Recap

## What Happened

- We had hackers (~25) come in, we didn't permit food in the lab.
- We started [Presentation](https://github.com/SMHS-Programming/club/blob/bdc2c3a9b15d9093296337a63e0daf9bd61d67fb/meetings/9_21_Meeting_II.pdf)
, we skipped hackEDU and hackingEDU slides as we didn't have time.
- We proceeded and started the workshop.
- 20 minutes in, we start cleaning up and having people save.
- Hackers left on time!

## Problems we faced

- Not a lot of time to work much on the workshop.
- Hackers wanted to eat lunch.
- People not being able to create an account for JSBin as the process of
github is very long.

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- We are thinking of maybe expanding workshop weeks with 2 weeks.
  - We will open a quick poll and check the hacker's opinion.
- Lunch:
  - We had hackers eat outside the lab as there were quite a few. They then came
   in a little later.
- JSBin complications signing up and saving work. Hackers had to sign up for
JSBin instead of github as it was very time consuming.

## Tips

- Timing is very important and predict how long it might take to set up the
computers and links.
- Prepare a short link (bit.ly) directly to the workshop.
- Have hackers signup **prior** to the workshop to JSBin/Github.
- Make sure you show what more advanced hackers can do with the workshop.

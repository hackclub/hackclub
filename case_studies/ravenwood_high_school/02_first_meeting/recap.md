# Recap

We had a total of 6 attendees, which is low, but I think this will grow throughout the year as people tell their friends how cool programming is and because the last meeting conflicted with a Science Bowl entry test (basically tryouts), which a lot of people interested in programming were at.

All attendees had no previous experience programming so that's a good thing- lots to learn and get excited about. We collected all their contact information via Google Form and added them to a GroupMe for communication.

In our next meeting, we'll be going through the building your first website workshop. Most people are willing to stay <= 1h after school but some 1.5h.

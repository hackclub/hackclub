# Planning
## My team and I had a meeting for ourselves in order to talk about all the details of what we hope to do for the club. We had a few interested prospective students sit in for input.
Some highlights were: 
 - to have a skype option for members of the club so that people who want to attend the club but have to be home.
 - to start the classes with instruction, then when students feel more comfortable with the work, they can have more individual projects
 - to try to get the class to go on a field trip to a hackathon
 - We can have a starting  set of things we want the students to learn (javascript,html/css) and expand depending on their interests.

# Recap

## Summary

- People (especially females) liked the GitHub stickers we gave out
- We gave out Sour Patches

## Questions

### What did do during the event and how did it differ from the plan?

We had issues coordinating stickers and food because Dan and Justin had no idea
where Selynna put everything.  However, after Selynna finished managing her
other club, we were able to get everything properly set on the table.

### What went well?

We were able to get a decent amount of people to join, and their skills vary as
well.  It's not all advanced people.

### What didn't go well?

Coordination.  Club leaders had other clubs and were distracted for part of the
time, and that was a huge issue why we probably got less signups than we
could've had.

### What tips do you have for other organizers?

Make sure your club organizers are briefed on the plan.  Disorganization is
an issue that is REALLY serious and should be avoided.

## Questions

### What you end up doing during the event and how did it differ from the original plan?

We were able to get a functioning club meeting, even though we had originally
considered canceling the meeting.  We had technical difficulties with our
emails, because we were trying to send 85 emails out and Google blocked us.

### What went well?

Being able to get people despite us not being able to send emails out until less
than an hour before the meeting.  We were also able to get our mission out to
the other hackers.

### What didn't go well?

Emailing.  We should've used our personal emails instead of being concerned on
trying to get our club email to work out. I think we would've been able to get a
significantly higher amount of attendance if people had gotten emails sooner.

### What tips do you have for other organizers?
For example:
Would you recommend doing or not doing what you did activity?
If you would recommend it, what might they watch out for?
etc.

Make sure that you send out emails 1-2 days before.  It's important to notify
members about the meetings going on.  Also, having prepared presentations that
you work on with your team is incredibly helpful, so everyone on the board
is in the loop.

#Recap

The meeting went decently this week. We did get to perform our ice breaker but with little positive reaction. 
From what I've seen the members of our club seem to want to focus more on the hardcore coding in comparison to 
social aspects of the club. Many people did show up (around 10) and finished most of the Twilio/Remote Control project but several problems 
did arise.

The first being lack of communication among the younger members. Our freshman members seem reluctant and even 
unwilling to talk to their fellow peers, whereas the Junior/Senior members seem fine with socializing with one another.
This should simply be natural freshman shyness and should wear off over time.

The second being the lack of understanding from some of our less-experienced members. From what I've seen and from what
some have even straight-forwardly told me is that they don't enjoy the lesson because all they did was copy and paste
code into JSBin. One freshman persisted to tell me that he was starting to lose his ability to find the fun in this.

Getting the freshman to open up should become easier as we become closer to them as time moves forward, and hopefully
I will find a better game to open the crowd up. The second problem should be harder to deal with as it is more 
lesson plan than actual club planning and strategy.

# Hiring Protocol

This is an initial document on how we approach hiring at hackEDU. For now it's
brief and incomplete, be we will iterate on this as we gain more experience and
learn more.

Rules:

- Both founders must be in agreement before an offer is made
- Offers will only be presented in writing (email is acceptable, online messages
  are not)
- A contract must be signed by both parties before the hire starts. The contract
  must outline:
  - Roles and responsibilities
  - Hours
  - Salary and payment schedule

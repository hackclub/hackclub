# PagerDuty Workflow

PagerDuty is Hack Club's on-call system and issue escalation policy. It works by scheduling turns for engineers to be responsible for resolving any problem that occurs in production.

## Create An Account

The first step is to create a PagerDuty account. You can read the full instructions [here][pagerduty_create_account].
Make sure to install the app for your phone and have notifications all set up before going to the next step.

Join the team by asking a staff member with a PagerDuty account to invite you to be in the PagerDuty team.

## On-Call

When on-call, it is your responsibility to resolve every issue that occurs in PagerDuty. Resolving an issue doesn't only mean closing it -- you can also mark it as unimportant, or bring in someone with more domain-specific knowledge to work on the fix. "Resolving" an issue only means the issue is marked as "ignore" or "resolved" in Sentry with a comment explaining why the issue was marked that way.

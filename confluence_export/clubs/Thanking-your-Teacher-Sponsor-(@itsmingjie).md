Regardless of their contributions to your club, teacher sponsors are essential to the success of your club. I mean, they’re the person who chose to voluntarily lend you their room and sit there for an extra hour after school when they could really just be home watching Netflix (or feeding their babies). So why not get them a simple “thank you” card at the end of the year?

On your card, make sure you include:

1. Your gratitude towards their contribution to your club
2. Your willingness to continuing to work with them in the coming years
3. A ton of unique Hack Club (and other random) stickers
4. Signatures of all co-leaders of your club
5. (Optional) A picture?

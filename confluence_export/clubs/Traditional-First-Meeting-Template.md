Hack Club meetings alternate between running workshops and free-form hacking (with demos). From here on out, we'll refer to meetings with workshops as _workshop days_ and meetings with free-form hacking and demos as _hack days_.

# The First Meeting

At the first meeting, start by explaining that Hack Club allows people to learn and build things together over the course of the year, and then have members begin building their _first real thing™_ (a personal website), using our [Personal Website](https://hack.af/intro) workshop.

At the second meeting, club members will complete their websites and demo their work at the end.

Attendance tends to drop by approximately 25% after the first two meetings. On the bright side, members who return for the third meeting tend to return to subsequent meetings for the rest of the year. Your goal is to reduce that attrition rate by making the first two meetings exciting, engaging, and inspiring.

Here are two quick tips to help that happen:

1. Bring food! Full bellies lead to fonder memories. Pastries or cookies from a local supermarket are easy, inexpensive, and effective.
2. Make an effort to chat with members who arrive early and leave late. Talk to them about their goals and interests, and get them personally pumped about what they'll do in Hack Club.

We recommend the following format for your first meeting. There are corresponding slides in the [First Meeting presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QhErlJS6rnqu78guPBWuJ1SUyPJKLbxzLNuSN9qVw0c/edit), and we've gone into more detail in the linked sections below.

1. Wait for hackers (club members) to arrive (5 minutes)
2. Introduction presentation (5 minutes)
3. Name game (10 minutes)
4. Build your first website workshop (45 minutes)
5. Free-form hacking (25 minutes)
6. Second meeting reminder

# Waiting for Hackers to Arrive

As hackers start to arrive, your goal is to make them feel welcome. We recommend doing the following four things to accomplish this:

1. Put the first slide of the aforementioned presentation on the projector
2. Put some music on (not too loud, [click here](https://open.spotify.com/user/zachlatta/playlist/16lRCHBANauZr4utynaA2B) for a good pre-made Spotify playlist)
3. Make people feel welcome as they walk in
4. Introduce yourself
5. Ask a couple questions to initiate conversation
   - "How did you hear about Hack Club?"
   - "What sorts of things are you interested in learning?"
   - "What other interests or hobbies do you have?"
6. If someone is sitting alone, be proactive and make conversation with them. Bring them into existing conversations.
7. You want people to feel good about their decision to come to Hack Club
8. Tell people what will be happening next (e.g., "We're going to get the first meeting started in about 10 minutes after people are done trickling in. In the meantime, please make yourself at home and let me know if I can be helpful with anything.")

# Introduction Presentation

The purpose of the introduction presentation is to tell members what Hack Club is, what you're going to be doing throughout the year, when you meet, and, _most importantly_, get them excited about the club.

Refer to the [slideshow presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QhErlJS6rnqu78guPBWuJ1SUyPJKLbxzLNuSN9qVw0c/edit), which contains slides to run with the introduction presentation.

# Name Game

The name game is a simple icebreaker activity that will warm the atmosphere and make club members more comfortable around each other. This will be especially helpful to freshman, who probably don't know people from the higher grades.

Have the club members gather in a large circle. Start by saying your name and creating a mnemonic for it (e.g., "Hey everyone, I'm Zach. Zany Zach."). Then have the person to your left do the same and then repeat what you said (e.g., "I'm Jolly Jane. And he is Zany Zach"). Then have the person to their left do the same and then say the names and mnemonics for everyone that has gone so far, in order. Continue doing this through the whole circle until everyone has gone. This will get significantly more difficult (and fun!) as more people go -- if someone gets stuck, encourage others to help them out.

# First Website Workshop

To get members started, you'll want to run the [Personal Website](https://hack.af/intro) workshop. It's going to walk club members through the process of building their first website and getting it online. It'll also get them set up with all the tools they'll use throughout Hack Club.

1. Tell everyone that, we'll begin by running the Personal Website workshop, which will walk them through the process of building their first website.
2. Show the slide with the output of the Personal Website workshop and tell everyone that this is what they'll build by the end of the workshop, which will take around 45 minutes.
3. Explain that after the workshop, the rest of the meeting will be completely free-form for members to continue building their websites. Show examples of websites that other Hack Clubs' members have made to give your members inspiration for their own sites. Say that at the end of the next meeting, everyone is going to come to the front and demo what they've built.

# Free-Form Hacking

After hackers finish the Personal Website workshop, they're going to transition into free-form hacking to continue building their websites. During this time, the most important thing for you to do is create an environment where people are comfortable asking for help.

When people do have questions, be eager to help them out. It's also a good idea to turn the music back on (not too loud, people should feel comfortable talking).

# Second Meeting Reminder

Five minutes before the meeting is over, get everyone's attention to remind them about the next meeting. Tell them when and where it'll be and make sure that everyone knows they will be finishing the websites they started on and presenting them at the end. Most importantly, thank them for coming to this meeting!

An effective way to remind people about club meetings is to send them a text message the night before. A popular service that lets you send announcements through text messages used by many of the clubs is called [Remind](https://remind.com/). Just make sure to set up your Remind account the day before the meeting so you don't run into any issues. The end of the club meeting would be a really good time for everyone else to setup an account. All they need to do now is text `81010`with your Club's Remind code (like`@ehs-hacks`) and that'll add them to your remind. You'll be able to send them any announcements about club meetings via text message the night before. If any members are concerned about privacy, inform them Remind does not give out their phone number.

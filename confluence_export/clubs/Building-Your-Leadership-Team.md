We recommend having 2-3 people running the club. When choosing your team, consider close friends who you think have strong leadership skills. In fact, leadership skills are far more important than technical abilities. Great clubs have been started by leaders that have never coded before.

It's also a good idea to have a mix of genders on the team, we've noticed that club member demographics tend to reflect those of the leaders (i.e., if the leadership is all-male, the club will be almost all-male).

When putting together the leadership team, choose one leader who is "in charge" (this will usually be you). This person will have the final authority to make changes in the club.

A common pitfall is to create a democratic selection process where everyone has an equal vote on decisions. We've found that this tends not to work because it makes it too easy for less-active leaders to override decisions of the club president. The best system is one where leaders get a say proportional to their investment in the club and the easiest way to implement this is to have a fair leader who delegates authority.

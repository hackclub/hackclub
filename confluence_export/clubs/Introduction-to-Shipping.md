# What is shipping?

Shipping code is another way to say sharing or delivering. Shipping is when you share your projects, complete or still in progress. Shipping is a great way to share what you are working on with the community, and get some helpful feedback.

# What can I ship?

You can ship anything! Feel free to ship whatever you want, and it does not even have to be related to code. It could be a personal website you are working on, a cool app or game, your own spoken language, and the list goes on. Have something cool? Ship it!

# How do I ship?

You can ship your projects on the **#ship** channel on [slack](http://hackclub.slack.com). Not in slack or know someone who wants to join? It is super easy to join, request an invitation [here](https://hackclub.com/community/), and you will get an email, finish registration and get in on the action!

Work in progress…

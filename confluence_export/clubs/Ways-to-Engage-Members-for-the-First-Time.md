# Member Engagement

Keeping members engaged is one of the most important attributes you can have in a club. It helps to retain members throughout the year and helps to make sure everyone is having a fun time!! Part of member engagement is creating a space where members are comfortable in participating, sharing, and talking. To do this you can ask icebreakers and play games that all members take part in either before, the middle, or after meetings. By creating a fun and friendly workspace, members will be encouraged to come to every/most meeting(s) and to share ideas about projects. They’ll also communicate better with their teammates which will make projects work smoother. You should also ask questions about the projects your members are working on. Ask about what they are doing with their website and what they want to make and what their goals are. You can also do positives at the end of your meetings where you share something positive you got out of the meeting or just share any highlights or shoutouts. They are also free to give feedback and constructive criticism.

# Examples of icebreakers would be…

“What color would you say the person to your right is and why?”

“If you could be anyone for 24 hours, who or what would you be?”

“If you could go anywhere in the universe or alternate dimension or movie or visit any time, where or when would you go?”

“What superpower would you have and why?”

You should also encourage members to come up with checkout questions.

# Examples of games…

_Fortunately Unfortunately:_ Create a story. One person says fortunately… then the next person says unfortunately. Ex. Once upon a time San Francisco was invaded by robots. Fortunately there was a team of hack club members to help save the city. Unfortunately they were greatly outnumbered. Fortunately, they were all incredibly smart and secretly had hacking super-powers. Unfortunately....

_Petra_: Four groups in four corners. Each group creates their own dance and other groups have to try and do their dance. If a group can’t do it then they are out. This continues until you have a winning group.

_Robot Maze:_ Split into two teams. One person in each team will be a robot. The rest of the team members have to code (kinda) the robot to get through an obstacle course. Which ever team’s robot finishes first wins.

_PewPew:_ Everyone huddles in a circle. Everyone looks down and someone counts to 3. On 3 everyone looks up but the goal is to avoid eye contact. Last 1 or 2 player(s) win. If you make eye contact you have to dramatically die.

_Play a game someone makes up_

_Two truths, One lie:_ Each person says 3 facts, 2 are true while 1 is false. Everyone tries to figure out which one is a lie

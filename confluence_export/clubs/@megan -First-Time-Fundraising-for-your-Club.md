_This article is meant to give you some ideas and actionables on how to raise money for your club. Note that, while these tips may work for hackathons, they won't raise quite enough money to be a reliable source of funding._

So, you're probably on this article because you're interested in raising some money... rest assured! Here are some ways to raise money.

# Ask for Donations

Sometimes, the quickest way to raise some seed money is by asking parents/friends/other adults for $5 donations. Two of our founders got $20 donations from their parents, and we used this money to buy pizza for our first club meeting. Asking many people for a tiny amount of money or getting two bigger donations will definitely be enough to run your first meeting!

# Selling Swag

You might be able to raise a little bit of money by selling some Hack Club swag, but you'll have to gauge your school's interest first. Low prices for stickers that many have never seen before will likely attract some people. I would recommend that you sell each sticker at less than $2 apiece. Ask your team to help you with marketing the stickers, and try to create an idea of uniqueness and scarcity around these swag items to create excitement!

# Restaurant Fundraisers

Mason Hack Club used restaurant fundraisers to make our first few hundred dollars, allowing us to invest in community outreach materials like robots. These kinds of fundraisers are relatively straightforward, but I'll lay out some tips.

The way that restaurant fundraisers work is typically that everyone who brings in a certain flyer will have a certain percentage of their sale donated back to your organization.

## Find a restaurant.

Given that you know your school is okay with these kinds of fundraisers, start your research on which restaurants you want to run a fundraiser at. Some factors to consider are:

- Is this restaurant close enough to convince people to go?
- What percentage of sales are donated back to you?
- What are some underlying policies?
  - Do they require you to make a certain amount of sales before they'll donate money?
  - Do they require flyers to be brought in?
  - Are there other demands they make?
- Are people generally interested in that restaurant?
  - People are more likely to go to less expensive, more popular chain restaurants than expensive ones that people don't know about

Here's a list of restaurants that you may be interested in running a fundraiser at:

- [Chipotle](https://community.chipotle.com/fundraisers) - 33% back
- [Buffalo Wild Wings](https://ewrf.buffalowildwings.com/) - 10% back
- [Panera](http://fundraising.panerabread.com/) - 20% back
- [Blaze Pizza](https://blazepizza.com/fundraising/) - 20% back

Allocate enough time after you register for the fundraising since restaurants tend to reply pretty slowly. If needed, follow up with whatever contact email you have.

## Marketing

Here are a few ways to get people to come to your fundraiser:

- Post the flyer on your social media
- Talk to people individually
- Invite a group of friends to go with you to eat
- Hand out flyers to people
- Get the flyer posted on your school's network
- Hang up posters in your classrooms & other relevant ones

I made cupcakes and gave each person a cupcake along with a flyer and lots of pressure to come to the fundraiser. It worked decently, but I wouldn't recommend you doing that unless you have a lot of free time and love baking.

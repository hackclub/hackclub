# Code of Conduct

## Why have a Code of Conduct?

Hack Club's community includes people from many different backgrounds. The Hack
Club contributors are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race,
religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.

The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of
behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles
can communicate effectively, productively, and respectfully.

The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the
community when they arise.

The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to
people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical in order for us to
build a thriving community; for Hack Club to be successful, it needs hackers
from all backgrounds.

With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate. The
Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom they
disagree.

## Where does the Code of Conduct apply?

If you join in or contribute to the Hack Club ecosystem in any way, you are
encouraged to follow the Code of Conduct while doing so.

Explicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to all official online Hack
Club groups, in person meetings, and events including:

- The [GitHub projects](https://github.com/hackclub/)
- The [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1501083703514499/)
- The [Slack](https://starthackclub.slack.com)
- The #hack-club IRC channel on Freenode
- Club Meetings

Other Hack Club groups (such as conferences, meetups, and other unofficial
forums) are encouraged to adopt this Code of Conduct. Those groups must provide
their own moderators and/or working group (see below).

## Hacker Values

These are the values to which people in the Hack Club community should aspire.

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
  - Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone
    is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in
    translation).
- Be thoughtful
  - Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be
    interpreted.
  - Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
  - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
- Be charitable
  - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
  - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- Avoid destructive behavior:
  - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a
    new conversation.
  - Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs;
    offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
  - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often
    leads to unnecessary conflict.
  - Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental
    indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and
    insults to a person or group.

People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to
misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be
defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was
intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to
provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of _all parties_ to
de-escalate conflict when it arises.

## Unwelcome behavior

These actions are explicitly forbidden in Hack Club spaces:

- Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
- Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion,
  sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
- Bullying or systematic harassment.
- Unwelcome sexual advances.
- Provoking any of these.

## Moderation

When you participate in [areas where the code of conduct
applies](#where-does-the-code-of-conduct-apply), you should act in the spirit of
the "Hacker values". If you conduct yourself in a way that is explicitly
forbidden by the Code of Conduct, you will be warned and asked to stop. If you
do not stop, you will be removed from our community spaces temporarily.
Repeated, willful breaches of the Code of Conduct will result in a permanent
ban. Staff and club leaders are held to a higher standard than other community
members. Complaints about staff and club leaders actions must be handled using
the reporting process below.

## Reporting issues

The Code of Conduct Working Group is a group of people that represent the Hack
Club community. They are responsible for handling conduct-related issues. Their
purpose is to de-escalate conflicts and try to resolve issues to the
satisfaction of all parties. They are:

|Name                | Slack Handle | Email               |
|--------------------|--------------|---------------------|
|Harrison Shoebridge | @harrison    | harrison@hackclub.io|
|Jonathan Leung      | @jonl        | jonathan@hackclub.io|
|Zach Latta          | @zrl         | zach@hackclub.io    |

If you encounter a conduct-related issue, you should report it to the Working
Group using the process described below. **Do not** post about the issue
publicly or try to rally sentiment against a particular individual or group.

- Mail conduct@hackclub.io
  - Your message will reach the Working Group.
  - Reports are confidential within the Working Group.
  - Should you choose to remain anonymous then the Working Group cannot notify
    you of the outcome of your report.
  - You may contact a member of the group directly if you do not feel
    comfortable contacting the group as a whole. That member will then raise the
    issue with the Working Group as a whole, preserving the privacy of the
    reporter (if desired).
  - If your report concerns a member of the Working Group they will be recused
    from Working Group discussions of the report.
  - The Working Group will strive to handle reports with discretion and
    sensitivity, to protect the privacy of the involved parties, and to avoid
    conflicts of interest.
- You should receive a response within 48 hours (likely sooner). (Should you
  choose to contact a single Working Group member, it may take longer to receive
  a response.)
- The Working Group will meet to review the incident and determine what
  happened.
  - With the permission of person reporting the incident, the Working Group may
    reach out to other community members for more context.
  - The Working Group will reach a decision as to how to act. These may include:
    - Nothing.
    - A request for a private or public apology.
    - A private or public warning.
    - An imposed vacation (for instance, asking someone to abstain for a week
      from the Facebook Group or Slack).
    - A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Hack Club spaces.
- The Working Group will reach out to the original reporter to let them know the
  decision.
- Appeals to the decision may be made to the Working Group, or to any of its
  members directly.

**Note that the goal of the Code of Conduct and the Working Group is to resolve
conflicts in the most harmonious way possible.** We hope that in most cases
issues may be resolved through polite discussion and mutual agreement. Bannings
and other forceful measures are to be employed only as a last resort.

Changes to the Code of Conduct (including to the members of the Working Group)
should be proposed by creating an issue [here] or making a pull request to this
document.

## Summary

- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
- Don't be destructive or inflammatory.
- If you encounter an issue, please mail
  conduct@hackclub.io.

## Code of Conduct

Hack Club's community includes people from many different backgrounds. Hack Club
is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

If you join in or contribute to the Hack Club ecosystem, you are encouraged to
follow our [Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md) while doing so.

## Find Something To Change

Usually, as a contributor you know what you want to work on. Perhaps something
along the lines of workshops, standards or implementing guidelines. However, if
you do not know where to begin [you can always search through the open GitHub
issues](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/issues) to find something suitable.
If you are a complete beginner (or have never contributed to an Open Source
repository before) you may be interested in [checking out issues with the
`first-timers-only` tag](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-timers-only).

## Talk About It On Slack

Wasting time is not fun! If you are going to make a big change to a workshop
(or even adding a new one) it is recommended that you
[join our Slack](https://slack.hackclub.io) and talk
about it on the [`#curriculum` channel](https://starthackclub.slack.com/messages/curriculum/).
To get an even more speedy response, mention `@jonl` and `@harrison`.

## Create An Issue

If you don't feel like completing a fix yourself, you can
[create an issue](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/issues/new) on the
repository. Remember to be as specific as possible so it is very easy for
someone else claim and implement.

## Make A PR

After you have made your changes and pushed them onto your GitHub
fork, you should create a
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). It is
best practice to have different Pull Requests for different groups of commits
which have different purposes. For example, you could submit both a Pull
Request containing a typo fix and a new workshop, because those are different
things they belong in different Pull Requests. If the Pull Request resolves an
issue, be sure to have the issue number in the description.

## Wait For Review

Before we can merge your code into the repository it has to be reviewed by one
of the core contributors. It will be assessed on how well it follows the
[contribution guidelines](GUIDELINES.md) and if it is intended to solve an
issue, how well it does so.

If all goes well, your code should be merged in very quickly... If not, then a
merge is usually just a quick fix away!

## Celebrate!

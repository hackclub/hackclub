# Club Leader Onboarding Protocol

Process for onboarding (and accepting) club leaders (in order):

## Application Process

1. An applicant submits an application to Hack Club through
   https://hackclub.io/apply. It's sent to the team as an email to
   team@hackclub.io.
2. If the application looks good, a team member responds to the applicant to set
   up an interview call. They also add the application to the "Applications"
   sheet in https://clubs.hackclub.io and update the application's status as the
   application progresses (ex. the interview call gets scheduled).
3. In the interview call the team member's goal is to get a good idea of the
   applicant's leadership skills. [Click here](#interview-template) for an
   interview questions template. The team member should be taking notes. After
   the call is over, they should upload their notes as a private gist and link
   them in the "Applications" sheet in https://clubs.hackclub.io (along with
   updating the application's row's other info, like phone number).
4. The team member should bring up the applicant with the team ASAP after the
   call and run them through their application and interview call. If all looks
   good, the team member should send an [acceptance email](#acceptance-email) to
   the applicant. In the acceptance email, they should set up a time for another
   call to onboard them into Hack Club properly.
5. In the onboarding call, the team member should run the applicant through the
   [onboarding checklist](#onboarding-checklist).
6. Going forward, the team member will have weekly calls with the applicant to
   help get the club started and be helpful in any way they can.

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uIcNYRY5ZLaLgEMO_1p-ZPmdaxeh1osy-0UpDjG2Z7w/edit?usp=sharing) for our slideshow template for Hack Days. Make sure to [customize it](https://archived.guide.hackclub.com/#/meetings/?id=slideshow-presentations).

# Waiting For Hackers

Put music on and have the first slide on the projector to let people know they're in the right place.

# Hacking on Projects

This'll be the same as the free-form hacking section in the second meeting. Members will continue building on what they started during the previous meeting. Your role will be to create an environment where people are comfortable asking for help.

# Running Demos

You'll want to do the same thing you did in the second meeting to run demos. [Click here](https://archived.guide.hackclub.com/#/meetings/second_meeting?id=demos) to go to second meeting's section on running demos.

# Reminder for Next Meeting

* Five minutes before the meeting is over, make sure to hit the last slide in the presentation and tell everyone the time and place for the next meeting.
* Let everyone know they’ll be doing a new workshop next time, and give a brief and enticing description.
* Thank them for coming!

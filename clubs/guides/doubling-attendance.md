Hey everyone! I wanted to share something with you all.

Below, you can see a before and an after just one **week** between two of my Hack Club meetings.

Here's something that helped me **increase member count from 8 to 14 in a week.**

I was already doing announcements, emailing the people on my list of about 6 - 8 people that showed up to every single meeting, and putting flyers around the school for our workshop, but I wanted different ways to hopefully get at least 15 people to show up.

**The most effective way to do this ended up being handouts.**

I went old school and actually walked up to students in the hallways, cafeteria (and even in some classrooms run by teachers that are nice enough to allow me to) and handed these students little slips that briefly say what, when and where the workshop is with a little '- hack club' so they know who it's from. (see doc below)

By walking up to students, looking them in the eye, and telling them what the workshop is, when it is, and why it's so awesome helped me achieve two things:

1. The students are forced to pay attention and aren't so ready to criticize / make fun of the name and concept of a "Hack" Club. (you're not going to immediately get defensive about something that someone is taking the time to stop you and chat about)
2. I got to see people's reactions to what Hack Club is, what our workshops are about, and most importantly, why some people aren't interested, which I took mental note of. I then used those mental notes and adjusted the way I approached other students about Hack Club.

It probably also helped that these students got to see that the person who essentially runs Hack Club wasn't the stereotypical image of a computer science club member, making the club a lot more approachable as opposed to tweets/announcements that could make your club sound teacher-run.

I think it's also important, as uncomfortable and narcissistic as it seems, to **put yourself out there** as the founder / exec / co-founder of your Hack Club publicly. People are **more receptive of a face rather than a concept of a club**.

On top of my own marketing, I had 3 other members from my Hack Club that were very involved helping me out with this so that I could show that other students were also really passionate about this, not just me.

Another thing was that we held a little get-together in the drama room at our school on the day of our meeting during lunch. This allowed people to come by, grab some chips, drinks, and cookies, and get to know the members of Hack Club (who we are, what we're about and that we're alive and well in the school community).

Hearing something like this would have helped me since my school isn't made up of the most involved or passionate students so if your school is like that. I hope these are good guidelines :)

By the way, here's what the **handouts** for the event looked like. I cut them up and one girl I passed it to even said, "Aww! You cut them up yourself?". This helped me understand that people appreciate the effort you put into things and are, as a result, more likely to also be passionate about it as well.

Let me introduce myself first, my name is Chaleb Pommells. I am the Program Director of We Code 2 a CS program run out of my church that I started. In this program we ended up raising $8,000 in grant money and here's what I did with it.

To start off, what the hell is a maker-space? A maker-space in reality is what you make it to be(no pun intended). There is no industry standard, no rules or procedures, etc. Your setup of your maker-space will be dependent on the people using it. To give you a basic idea of how to set one of these up I'll use my program as an example. Remember there is no wrong or right way to setup a maker-space but this is to give a general idea on how one runs.

So to give you some background I started off We Code 2 as a lecture based CS program for 3rd-12th graders. It completely sucked. I had about 40 people in one classroom with little me standing at the front of the white board...lecturing. I noticed a decline in membership so I decided to poll the exiting members. The results...well they weren't pretty. "63% of the exiting participant group said they left the program due to teaching style". I will say I was a little hurt since I was the only teacher at the time so I knew they were talking about me 😭. This was a wake up call. Either I had to find some way to fix this issue or risk my program crumbling to the ground.

I dedicated one week to personal meetings with all the participants in the program who gave me criticism from clothes(I wore a button down lol) to again teaching style. At this point in time we had no monetary sponsors and no way of implementing some of the changes the participants wanted. So I talked with the Accounting Dept at my church and the awesome people who work there gave me some good advice. RAISE. MORE. MONEY. Made enough sense for me so I started looking for grants. Grant searching...sucks and so does grant writing. On my 4th week searching for grants I came across one from an organization called the Miam-Dade Children's Trust. I compiled a list of templates for grant proposals and through some wizardry I made something that didn't look too crappy.

I got all the paperwork together and received a response in 2 weeks. So at this point I have the $8,000 grant. I have the support of the Church. What now? Using the surveys and notes from my personal meetings with program participants I bought things like raspberry pis', Lego Mindstorm kits, tablets, smart boards, cameras, bean bag chairs, and some other knick-nacks. After some, delivery fails and having to pickup laptops in Boca Raton(don't ask) I had the equipment. I came in on a Saturday morning to setup and left at around 3AM on a Sunday.

We had our next meeting on Monday so I came in around 6AM and made sure everything was setup. The kids came in and their faces made me the happiest person in the world. They came in from all directions some ran over to the robots others picked up the tablets, it was great. The end!

Oh wait you really thought that was it(don't worry I thought the same thing). We had all this great equipment but so what. How did this actually fix anything? The silver bullet was... I took down the whiteboard. Yep I literally took the whiteboard off the wall. This was pretty weird for me but the symbolic effect it had on the kids was evident. I adopted a system of controlled anarchy. Instead of telling kids what to work on I asked them what THEY wanted to work on and took it from there. I got some volunteers from the local university to take on roles of mentors and helpers and continued building up. Instead of having daily lesson we had "jam sessions". In these sessions the kids came in with an idea, got some friends to get behind it, and just made the coolest shit ever.

Wait so Chaleb you just completely abandoned those kids and let them do whatever they wanted? No and yes. No I didn't leave them to fend for themselves in the Cyber Land, but yes I let them choose what project ideas they wanted to do. In adapting the method of controlled anarchy(oxymoronic lol) I still was able to show them how to get they're ideas from idea stage to shipped but I did it in a way that allowed them to feel in control and learn and work at their own pace.

So I guess this is it. If you guys have questions or comments or have a working example of this system of your own feel free to DM me in Slack at @Chaleb. Thanks for reading!

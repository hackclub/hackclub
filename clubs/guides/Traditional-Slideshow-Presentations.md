In addition to the templates for the [first](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QhErlJS6rnqu78guPBWuJ1SUyPJKLbxzLNuSN9qVw0c/edit) and [second](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WCerU9JhJY6L5kM7SrIlYcABwxpqcjmxmSRXilvWAaY/edit) meetings, we've also created two more templates to help you prepare. We'll refer to these throughout the sections below. One of the presentations is a standard [Workshop Day Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LnbH5c7K-V608jMXNk3VyoVaZLaEuet7faHZCbYhOCs/edit), and the other is a standard [Hack Day Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uIcNYRY5ZLaLgEMO_1p-ZPmdaxeh1osy-0UpDjG2Z7w/edit). To use the presentations:

1. Make a copy of the presentation to customize it for your club (to do this, go to `File > Make a copy...`).
2. In the first two slides, update the recap (if applicable) and the schedule for what you'll be doing.
3. Customize the remainder of the slides according to the type of meeting:
  -  For Workshop Day:
    -   Choose the workshop you'll want to run for this meeting and put its name in the appropriate slide.
    -   Add the images corresponding to this workshop. A good tip is to add one or two standard examples of what the workshop will produce, and then one or two examples of what it would look like to expand on the workshop, as inspiration.
    -   Include a link at the end of the workshop to`workshops.hackclub.com/[WORKSHOP]`.
  -  For Hack Day:
    -   Add the images corresponding to the workshop started in the previous Workshop Day, perhaps one standard example and a few examples that take it further.
    -   Choose a workshop for the following week and add a sneak preview to the end of the slideshow.
4. Double check: make sure you have replaced any text in brackets, like `[HIGH_SCHOOL]`, with the proper information for your club, as well as any sample images, with actual images.
5. Share your customized presentation with your leadership team and get feedback.
6. Publish to your club's website.

Most high schools require you to register your club with the student council or school administration before having your first meeting.

Generally they have an application to fill out ([click here for an example](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTiXm_NsJswpu1bFEZ5qPaE7xWTBR0uy19y1d0ha_7lOi_DQ/viewform)). Some schools require having a club constitution that outlines the club's purpose and operational procedures. We've created a template constitution for you, which you can find here.

This shouldn't take very long, especially once you have a teacher sponsor backing you.

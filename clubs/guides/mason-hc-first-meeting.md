This Tuesday, September 3rd, marked the first club meeting for the Mason Hack Club. Over 80+ students attended to learn, code, and interact with the community — making this Hack Club meeting the largest in the United States to date.

The meeting started off in Room B112 like usual but quickly swelled in size to the point where we ended up moving to Mason’s library.

_Much better :)_

Following the beginning of the meeting using @JoshC’s custom attendance system to check everyone in, we broke up into multiple rooms for beginner and advanced topics: HTML and CSS for newcomers to the club, and an introduction to React.js for the veterans.

We consolidated with a bit about what we do at Mason Hack Club, who we are, events we’ve run in the past, and how to become a permanent member of the club. If you’d like, you can view our presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11S97IMubLCH2RInLUkn6R43NvKw_EFhJPzcpT_GFDr0/edit?usp=sharing).

Finally, everyone got to leave the meeting with something built, whether that be a personal website or React ‘hello world’, and some free pizza and swag to boot.

We can’t wait to see all of our members again next Tuesday! And until next time — happy hacking!

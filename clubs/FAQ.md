# Frequently Asked Questions

### How long will the application take?

Filling out your application should take around 45 minutes to an hour and the leader profiles should take about 30 minutes each.

### Do I need anything to fill out application?

[You should already have a team](./leadership_preface.md).

### Can I lead a club by myself?

You may -- it's your club. That said, what if...

- you are sick / studying / traveling and can't lead meetings
- you are graduating and haven't decided who will lead next year
- you are stressed out by the amount of work it takes to be a club leader

It's tough to make a good single-leader club and you are much more likely to succeed with a co-leader or two. Nearly all our best clubs have more than one leader, so applications with co-leaders will have a slight advantage.

### How much does this cost?

$0. Null. Nothing. Nada.

All of our program is 100% free.

### How many hours should I expect to put into this?

Every club is different and has different needs each week. On average though, clubs break down into 2 categories

1. before the first meeting, most leaders commit around 7-10 hours per week marketing and planning to launch
2. a few meetings in, once members can show up without reminders most leaders commit around 4-5 hours per week

### We've already organized our own club. Why should we apply?

Many of our applicants are from clubs that have already started running, sometimes for years. We provide resources and a community you won't get anywhere else.

### What should my YouTube video be about?

### What is the acceptance/rejection rate?

We don't publish our acceptance/rejection rate. We receive hundreds of applications from people asking us to "hack facebook" and other forms of spam, so it's not a good indicator what your chances are of getting in.

To be perfectly honest, if you apply with detailed responses and show that you've started organizing your club, we'll probably accept you.

The application is a tool to get you thinking about your club and for us to get an understanding of your strengths and weaknesses are.

### Once I submit my application, how long until I start the club?

After submitting your application, we'll get back to you in 1-3 days to accept or reject the application.

As long you follow each of the steps in the application process, and we decide to accept you into our program, you should be ready to hold your first meeting within 2 weeks.

### What happens after I submit my application?

You should get a confirmation email at the address you logged in with to confirm your application reached us.

In 1-3 days we'll get back to you over email or text and let you know if you've been accepted or rejected. If you haven't heard anything from us after 3 days, [contact us](#how-do-i-ask-you-a-question).

### What happens if I'm accepted?

We'll schedule an onboarding call with you. During the call we'll get to know each other and plan out the club.

### What is something surprising or interesting?

We read a _ton_ of applications per day, so this question is included to keep it fun for us to review them all. Don't overthink the question, just jot down a few sentences that comes to mind.

Or write an essay. I'm an FAQ page, not a cop.

### How do I ask you a question?

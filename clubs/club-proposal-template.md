# New Club Proposal
### Club Name: 
Hack Club (in this case, "hack" means solving problems cleverly with code)
### Applicant:
Akaanksh Raj
### Purpose:
To allow students at GAHS to learn to write code.
### When and Where will we meet:
For about 1 hour in [Teachers] room. The day will be decided after approval.
### Necessities:
Surfaces, Internet and for some website to be unblocked if they were blocked. (ex: hackclub.com, github.com, c9.io)
### Why?
There is currently no course at GAHS that teaches code; this club hopes to teach club members code, and expose them to the coding world, which can help students discover their love for code. We will enlist the help of Hack Club. Hack Club is a "…nonprofit international network of high school coding clubs that teach beginners how to code; In addition, it provides a brand, curriculum, a club structure, and an online community to support clubs as they grow." So far, Hack Club has helped students in 13 countries and 163 high schools start and run successful Hack Clubs.
### More about the Club:
The club is like a year-long hackathon with some teaching. At the beginning of each meeting, a workshop will be run, and towards the end and the first half of the next meeting, the members can experiment and add new features to the "product." They can use a search engine or ask fellow members for help. And in the end of the second meeting, the members get to present their products and share what they learnt or failed on. We would also like to make websites for some of the other clubs when all students have gained enough knowledge and experience.

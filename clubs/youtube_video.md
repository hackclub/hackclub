# The Application Video

The video should be one minute long and should be uploaded to YouTube.
If you don't want other people to find it, mark it as unlisted (**not private**).
We should be able to view it from your link without logging in to YouTube.

We're trying to get a sense of who you are and how we can best work with you.
Tell us why you'd be good club leaders, what other hobbys you have, or whatever you want.
The important part of the video is that we finish watching it.
Practice recording the video a few times, but **don't follow a script** -- it really shows when you're speaking without one.

Before submitting your application, play it back to yourself and make sure everything you said can be heard.
We review _tons_ of applications and hate it when we have to skip a video because we can't hear what's going on.

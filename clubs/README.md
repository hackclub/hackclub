## What is a Hack Club?

We think of Hack Clubs very broadly:

- Hacking is creative problem solving (it doesn't have to be about technology)
- A Hack Club is an after-school high school club where people come together to
  hack

Most Hack Clubs end up looking like never-ending hackathons, where club members
come together twice a week (generally for ~1.5 hours) and work on projects
together. To get members started, we have a series of 1 hour workshops (in the
[`workshops/`](../workshops/) directory) to get members started. More on how
workshops work in [_The First Meeting_](#the-first-meeting).

Throughout the school year, Hack Clubs go to (and sometimes host) hackathons,
work on larger group projects, and---most importantly---build a thriving
community of hackers at their high schools.

In the sections below we'll walk you through the process of setting up your Hack
Club and running your first few meetings. After you've gotten the first two
meetings down, you should be set for the remainder of the school year :smile:.

## Planning Your Hack Club

You should plan on starting this process two to three weeks before having your
first meeting. Fortunately there isn't an enormous amount of planning needed to
start a club, but it's very important to get each of the following right.

- [ ] Leadership team
- [ ] Teacher sponsor and space
- [ ] Club registration
- [ ] 50 student sign-ups for the first meeting

_(each of the sections below corresponds with a bullet point)_

### Leadership Team

You'll want 2-3 people on the primary leadership team running the club. When
choosing your leadership team, we recommend working with close friends who you
think have strong leadership skills. It's also a good idea to have a mix of
genders on the leadership team. Correlation doesn't imply causation, but the
club member demographics mirror the demographics of the leadership team in many
clubs.

Also, leadership skills are _far_ more important than technical skills. A common
pitfall many clubs run into is selecting the leaders based on their technical
skills rather than their leadership capacity.

**Great clubs have been started by leaders that have never coded before.**

When putting together the leadership team, make sure to choose one leader who's
"in charge" (this will generally be you). This will be the person that has the
final authority to make changes in the club.

A common pitfall is to create a democratic selection process where everyone has
an equal vote on decisions. We've found that this tends not to work because it
makes it too easy for less-active leaders to override decisions of the club
president. The best system is one where leaders get a say proportional to their
investment in the club, and the easiest way to implement this is to have a fair
leader.

### Teacher Sponsor and Space

A good teacher sponsor is key to having access to regular space for club
meetings and a good relationship with your school. Your teacher sponsor is the
person who will regularly lend you a classroom for after-school meetings. And
when things go wrong with the school administration, your teacher sponsor will
be your advocate. Choosing the wrong teacher sponsor can be fatal to clubs, so
give it careful thought.

The best teacher sponsors are personally invested in spreading coding to
students. This is generally the teacher most likely to start a computer science
class (or, if you already have one, the current computer science teacher). If
you're new to your school and not very familiar with the teachers, a good place
to start looking is the math and science teachers. If your school has a computer
lab, start with the teachers that teach classes in it (or if your school has
classrooms with computers in it, start with the teachers with computer
classrooms).

Once you've decided on a few potential teacher sponsors, it's time to reach out
to them and tell them about your idea to start a Hack Club. The best way to do
this is to come to their classroom right after school ends (or during lunch) and
talk to them in person. If you don't already know the teacher, introduce
yourself, tell them that you're looking for a teacher sponsor for this thing
called a Hack Club you're starting, and explain the club to them. Here's an
example of what you might want to start off by saying:

> Hi Ms. Byrd, I'm Zach. I'm currently a freshman and I'm starting a Hack Club
> at the school. It's essentially a computer coding club where students meet
> regularly to build things like apps, websites, and games together (and
> learn!). I've put together a leadership team and I'm currently looking for a
> teacher sponsor for the club. I figured I'd reach out because I heard you ran
> the Hour of Code in your classroom in December.

You'll want to get your teacher sponsor to commit to providing a space
after-school twice a week for at least an hour and a half (ideally two hours, so
there's extra time for members to stay after meetings).

The difficulty of getting a teacher sponsor varies widely school to school. At
some schools you'll find a good teacher sponsor on your first try and at others
it'll take talking to 5-6 teachers. The most important thing is to not give up
and to be persistent.

### Club Registration

Most high schools require you to register your club with the student council or
school administration before having your first meeting.

Generally they have an application to fill out
([click here][lowell_club_application] for an example). Some schools require
having a club constitution that outlines the club's purpose and operational
procedures. We recommend asking for a template constitution from the school
(most have them) and just filling it out -- the constitution won't have too much
impact on your day-to-day operations.

This shouldn't take very long, especially once you have a teacher sponsor to
back you.

### Student Sign-Ups

Now for the most important part of this whole process: actually getting people
to come to your club.

Most schools have a day for advertising clubs at the beginning of each semester.
This commonly called the "club fair", "club day", "club rush", or "club
showcase". It is _extremely important_ that you have a presence at this event --
this is your opportunity to get the most important members (freshman and
sophomores) to your first club meeting.

The best way to take advantage of your school's "club day" (or equivalent) is to
bring food and be _super proactive_ about getting people to give you their name,
email, and phone numbers. It's boring, but a pencil and a clipboard with a list
of people's info is often the best way to collect this information (though feel
free to experiment).

Your sign-up goals should be driven by how many people you want to attend your
meetings -- set your goal for number of sign-ups well above the number of people
you want to attend your meetings. If you want to have 20 to 30 members come to
your first meeting, you should shoot for at least 50 sign-ups. If you want 50 to
come, shoot for at least 80.

## The First Meeting

The first two meetings of each semester are the most important, since they will
largely influence who comes back.

You should expect 25% of the members at the first two meetings to not come back
to the third. The members who come to the third meeting tend to stay for the
rest of the year, so your primary goal for this meeting is to get members to
come back to the second meeting (and in the second meeting, it'll be to get
members to come back to the third).

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, here's one quick tip: a simple, but easy
way to dramatically improve your first meeting is to bring food. Pastries or
cookies from a local supermarket are cheap and work well.

For the first meeting, you'll want to share what your Hack Club will be doing
throughout the year and have them build their _first real thing™_ (a personal
website), using our [Portfolio](../workshops/portfolio/README.md) workshop.
After they complete the workshop, they'll have the remainder of the meeting to
keep building their website to make it unique. At the second meeting, you'll
pick up where you left off and work up to demos, where everyone from the club
will come to the front and demo what they built at the end of the meeting.

We recommend the following format for your first meeting. For each item in the
schedule, there is a corresponding (and linked) section below. We've also
created a slideshow presentation to help you run your first meeting.
[Click here][presentation] to go to it. You'll want to make a copy of the
presentation to customize for your club (you can go to `File > Make a copy...`
to do this). We'll be referring to this presentation throughout the following
sections.

1. [Wait for hackers (club members) to arrive (5 minutes)][1]
2. [Introduction presentation (5 minutes)][2]
3. [Name game (10 minutes)][3]
4. [Build your first website workshop (45 minutes)][4]
5. [Free-form hacking (25 minutes)][5]
6. [Reminder with details for second meeting][6]

#### Waiting for Hackers to Arrive

As hackers start to arrive, your goal is to make them feel welcome. We recommend
doing the following four things to accomplish this:

1. Put the first slide of the previously mentioned presentation on the projector
2. Put some music on (not too loud, [click here][playlist] for a good pre-made
   Spotify playlist)
3. Make people feel welcome as they walk in
  - Introduce yourself
  - Ask a couple questions to initiate conversation:
    - "How did you hear about Hack Club?"
    - "What sorts of things are you interested in learning?"
    - "What other interests or hobbies do you have?"
  - If someone is sitting alone, be proactive and make conversation with them.
    Bring them into existing conversations.
  - You want people to feel good about their decision to come to Hack Club
4. Tell people what will be happening next (ex. "We're going to get the first
   meeting started in about 10 minutes after people are done trickling in. In
   the meantime, please make yourself at home and let me know if I can be
   helpful with anything.")

#### Introduction Presentation

The purpose of the introduction presentation is to tell members what Hack Club
is, what you're going to be doing throughout the year, when you meet, and, _most
importantly_, get them excited about the club.

The beginning of the previously mentioned slideshow presentation contains slides
to run with the introduction presentation.

#### Name Game

The name game is a simple icebreaker activity that will warm the atmosphere and
make club members more comfortable around each other. This will be especially
helpful to freshman, who probably don't yet know people from the higher grades.

Have the club members gather in large circle. Start by saying your name and a
mnemonic for it (ex. "Hey everyone, I'm Zach. Zany Zach."). Then have the person
to your left do the same and then repeat what you said (ex. "I'm Jolly Jane. And
he is Zany Zach"). Then have the person to their left do the same and then say
the names and mnemonics for everyone that has gone so far, in order. Continue
doing this through the whole circle until everyone has gone. This will get
significantly more difficult (and fun!) as more people go -- if someone gets
completely stuck, encourage others to help them out.

#### First Website Workshop

To get members started, you'll want to run the
[Portfolio](../workshops/portfolio/README.md) workshop. It's going to walk club
members through the process of building their first website. We recommended
doing the following to run the Portfolio workshop (and we've prepared slides, in
the previously linked slideshow presentation to help run it).

1. Tell everyone that to start out, we're going to run the Portfolio workshop,
   which will walk them through the process of building their first website
2. Show the slide with the output of the Portfolio workshop and tell everyone
   that this is what they'll build by the end of the workshop, which will take
   around 45 minutes
3. Say that after the Portfolio workshop, the rest of the meeting will be
   completely free-form for them to continue building their websites. Show the
   slides with examples of websites other people in Hack Clubs have made to give
   your members ideas for directions they can take their sites. Say that at the
   end of the next meeting, everyone is going to come to the front and demo what
   they built.

#### Free-Form Hacking

After hackers finish the Portfolio workshop, they're going to transition into
free-form hacking to continue building their websites. During this time, the
most important thing for you to do is create an environment where people are
comfortable asking for help.

When people do have questions, be eager to help them out. It's also good idea to
turn the music back on (not too loud, people should feel comfortable talking).

#### Second Meeting Reminder

Five minutes before the meeting is over, get everyone's attention to remind them
about the next meeting. Say when and where it'll be and that everyone will be
finishing the websites they started on and presenting them at the end in it. And
thank them for coming to this meeting!

## The Second Meeting

The second meeting will pick up where the first left off. The majority of the
meeting will be free-form time for hackers to continue expanding their portfolio
websites. At the end of the meeting, everyone will come up to the front of the
room and demo their website. Like the first meeting, bringing food is a good
idea :wink:.

Here's our suggested schedule:

1. Wait for hackers to arrive (5 minutes)
2. Announcements (5 minutes)
3. Free-form hacking (45 minutes)
4. Demos (20 minutes)

# Twilio Workshop

_In attendance:_

- Jonathan Leung
- Zach Latta

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jonathan will manually test Twilio to see if he can signup multiple times
(12ish) with his credit card. Assuming that this works:

- Jonathan will move ahead and finish creating a client side library of Twilio
  using Browserify that only sends texts and makes phone calls.
  - This library will have restrictions on it so that no one can accidentally
    create more than 100 phone calls / texts per given session.
- Club leaders will create a new Twilio account with a the hackEDU promo code
  that club members can use. This promo code last until ~January 24th with $100
  worth of credit.
- Club leaders will make it known to members not to abuse the credit and that if
  they need more crediit, they can create their own twilio accounts.

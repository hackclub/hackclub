    - Getting the word out

    - First year
      - many people didn't come regularly the first year
    - Issues during the school year
      - Had Google Groups and Facebook. Many members didn't have Facebook -
        those members had to use Google Groups.
      - Occasionally deciding who's lead on some club projects
  - Raphael
    - Had teacher sponsor committed and got some other people interested
    - Started talking with the vice principal (who's in charge)
    - Put together bylaws and get interest (he said)
      - Raphael then got sheet filled with saying that they'd come regularly
    - Vice principal had to talk to the board and got them to approve of the
      club before starting
    - Getting the word out
      - Big Facebook groups for the school - posted in a variety of groups
      - Told people to tell their friends
      - Tons of people don't have Facebook accounts. Going around with
        spreadsheet was a great way to get people interested.
      - Flashy posters
      - Told all of the teachers who teach computer classes (everything from
        word processing to programming) to spread the word to their classes
      - Other clubs (cross country in particular)
    - Issues during the school year
      - Difficult to tell what to do during an individual club day
        - Had conflicts - wanted people to work on anything they wanted, but
          also wanted people to work on specific projects
      - Communication - most of it was by Facebook, but many members didn't have
        Facebook accounts
- Hack Camp model
  - Have to watch out for midterms and finals
- Longer meetings
  - Raphael
    - Administration wise, it's possible
    - Ran from 3:30 - 6pm regularly
    - Sponsor probably wouldn't come twice a week
    - It's tough when people don't come to meetings sequentially - they just get
      them back up to speed after they missed it
  - Shriyash
    - Club meetings ran from 3-4, occasionally from 3-5
    - Got together during breaks sometimes at the club leader's houses
    - Could come together twice a week if they wanted
    - Held meetings Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays - many people came on
      Fridays
    - It's tough when people don't come to meetings sequentially - they just get
      them back up to speed after they missed it
- Demo-day, competition
  - Shriyash thinks it's a good idea

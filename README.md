## Project Management

We use ZenHub with GitHub Issues to manage our team workflow.

Our board has the following columns:

- **New Issues** - Issues that have not been categorized into a column yet. This
  is the default location for new issues.
- **Ideas** - Issues that we're not actively working on as a team, but may
  decide to prioritize in the future.
- **Backlog** - Issues that we're actively planning on addressing, but aren't
  currently high priority.
- **Todo** - Issues that are in our immediate team queue.
- **In Progress** - Issues that are currently being worked on by a member of the
  team. When a team member begins working on an issue, they should drag it into
  _In Progress_.
- **Review** - The deliverable for the task has been submitted and is currently
  being reviewed by another member of the team. This is usually in the form of a
  pull request.

_*Pull requests should be put next to their corresponding issue on the board. If
there is not a corresponding issue, they should flow through the board like an
issue._

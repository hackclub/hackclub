We started hackEDU because we believe in the power of high schoolers to change
the world.

Your interview left us inspired for the future. We wish we had the community
you're building when we were in high school and we are excited to invite you and
your co-founder(s) to be Lab Directors as part of the Labs Team. _`NOTE:
Customize this last sentence per their co-founder situation.`_

As a Lab Director, you'll be responsible for figuring out what is working in
your club, what isn't, and collaborating with the rest of the Labs Team to build
(and document) the best club possible. The objective of the Labs Team is to
build a playbook that makes it easy for anyone to start a great club (here's the
playbook we used to run the last cohort of Hack Camp:
https://github.com/hackclub/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook). We'll talk
more about what this collaboration process will look like once we've finished
accepting everyone to Labs.

To be a part of Labs, we'll need you to select one director that will take lead
on communication with us and the remainder of the Labs Team. Communication will
be key.

Here are expectations we have for each Labs Director:

- Time Commitment: 5 hours/week
- Share what you learn with other Labs Directors
- Actively contribute to the playbook
- Write blog post documenting every meeting
- Weekly call with hackEDU

Note: The Labs Directors will iterate on expectations together

We won't be running hackEDU Labs. You will. You, with the other Lab Directors,
are going to lay the foundation for coding communities that will spread across
the globe. This won't be easy, but you won't be in it alone.

Please let us know if you would like to be part of this journey by Thursday.

Let's change the world together,

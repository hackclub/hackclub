| Total                   |   0 | 221.82 | 341.11 | 153.28 | 5356.84 | 6019.52 | 6547.65 | 5983.29 | 7933.47 | 13019.3 | N/A | N/A | 45576.28 |

The biggest difference between our estimated budget and our actual spending was
program expenses. In the budget we assumed that we'd take on a fixed cost per
club, but when it came time to onboard more clubs we decided to give the clubs
more autonomy and encourage them to raise money independently rather then having
us financially support them. That said, we do plan to eventually send something
along the lines of a "care package" (stickers, t-shirts, banners, etc) to new
clubs when they first get started.

We were also expecting to pay administative expenses to handle accounting and
similar services to keep the organization running, but we were fortunate enough
to get everything comped or taken care of by our fiscal sponsor.

# 2016

We are currently spending an estimated $10,000 each month. $8,920 is spent on
staff salaries and $1,000 on software, transporatation, food, and other
miscellaneous expenses for the staff.

The following is our planned budget for 2016.

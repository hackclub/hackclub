## Overview

The primary objective of the club fair is to get as many people to the first
club meeting as possible.

Your primary target: _freshman_.

There are two primary strategies to do this:

- [Be a fanatic peacock](#be-a-fanatic-peacock)
- [Be extremely welcoming](#be-extremely-welcoming)
- [Follow up](#follow-up)

If you do the first two, you'll look like this:

Why is this important?
[Because first impressions make a big impact](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec07/).

### Be a fanatic peacock

If people don't think you're crazy, you're not being crazy enough. Every other
  club is giving the same boring spiel. Attract as much attention as possible:

- Get a booth in the middle of the event, not somewhere off to the
  side.
- Having a giant eye-catching sign that is easy to see from far away.
- Having desirable and unique items to give away/sell.
- Do something else that is completely crazy and eye-catching.

### Be extremely welcoming

If you're standing behind your table waiting for people to come, you're doing
it wrong. Don't wait for people to come. Invite them:

- Smile. 
- Initiative conversation with everyone.
- Sound excited. Bring the energy.
- Make eye contact.
- Stand in front of your table.

### Follow up

Most clubs fail to follow up at all. Club fair attracts people's initial
attention but that's not enough to get them to show up to the first meeting.
They likely met 10 clubs at the fair so make sure they remember you:

- Make sure to collect everyone's numbers or emails so that you can follow-up.
  An easy way to do this is to have clipboards with sign up sheets for each
  club member at the fair. Make sure you have more than enough pens.
- As they walk away, always end with "See you at the meeting on
  Tuesday, Sally!"
- Mentioning their name multiple times helps make the interaction personal
- Send everyone a text and/or email right away after the club fair. Timing is
  important. Don't wait. Maybe send something simple like "Welcome to the
  revolution!"

<!-- TODO: Gather nicely written examples! -->

## Before the club fair

### Prep the team

- Try to have 3-5 people at the club fair
- Create a list of questions that you think people will ask you and make sure
  that every officer answers the questions in a similar way
- Collectively come up with a 30 second pitch that gets people excited about
  your club.

If you want to make an amazing pitch, follow [this
guide.](http://venturehacks.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Pitching-
Hacks.pdf)

#### Play-by-play

With your officers who will be at the club fair, walk through the
play by play of what you want someone coming up to your booth to **feel**
and what you DON'T want someone coming up to your booth to **feel**.

- Practice role playing the club fair (where someone acts as a potential new
  club member and someone else is a club officer at the club fair)
- Don't let people get away with being boring in practice. You practice how
  you play. Make sure people are ridiculously high energy even in practice.
- You shouldn't have to memorize the pitch. Make sure it feels natural.
  Different people might have different pitches that work for them and that's
  ok.

**Easily excitable freshman:**

Here is an example of an interaction for which a freshman is excited about
building a website.

| Person       | Script                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **OFFICER**  | _(with a wide smile and warm friendly voice)_ Hey! I'm Laura!                                                                                                                                                 |

| **FRESHMAN** | Hi, I'm Joanne.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **OFFICER**  | We're Hack Club. We learn and make awesome things together with code. For example, Gina built this at her first meeting last year!                                                                            |

| **OFFICER**  | She had _**0**_ experience and made this from scratch on her first meeting!                                                                                                                                   |
| **FRESHMAN** | _(with excitedness)_ Whooooaah! That's pretty cool! I wish I could do that!                                                                                                                                   |
| **OFFICER**  | _(with the a smile and assurance)_ YEAH! You totally can! Come stop by our first meeting this Wednesday at 4pm in Mrs. Nelson's room in 110. By the end of the meeting, you'll have your own website as well! |
| _OFFICER_    | _Hands FRESHMAN a clipboard_ and passes her a flyer as well.                                                                                                                                                  |
| _FRESHMAN_   | _Fills out her name, email, and cell phone information on the signup form._                                                                                                                                   |
| **OFFICER**  | So do you have any questions about Hack Club?                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **FRESHMAN** | Hmmm... Not right now!                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **OFFICER**  | Cool, if you ever do, that flyer has my email and number on it! I'll see you Wednesday?                                                                                                                       |
| _OFFICER_    | Motions for a high-five.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| _FRESHMAN_   | Reciprocates the high-five.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **FRESHMAN** | Yes! Definitely!                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**Less easily excitable freshman:**

This interaction illustrates how you might meet someone where they are by
finding out what their interests are and relating them to the programming club.

| **OFFICER**    | _(Laura deliberately keeping a warm understanding smile on her face but lowering her enthusiasm a bit to meet Joanne's energy)_ So what kinds of things do you like to do for fun?                        |
| **FRESHMAN**   | _(slowly with uncertainty)_ Hmmm... Well I guess like to draw?                                                                                                                                            |

**Not Ideal**

_Thoughts going through someone's mind that you want to avoid_

- Hm, that club table seems dead, there's no one there.
- Hm, that club table looks so boring, there's nothing on it.
- Oh, I didn't even notice that booth until the end of the club fair because
  nothing about your booth caught their attention.

**Ideal**

- Wait, why is there a giant line in front of that table? Lemme check that out!
- Wait, wtf, why is there someone in a dinosaur suit over there?
- Hey, Jessica, David, did you see that booth over there?! They're nice and
  selling the best kettle corn ever!
- Whoah, they have a crazy sign that's super colorful, let me go check that out!

#### When they come up to your booth

**Not Ideal**

- Hm... No ones here. I guess they all left. They must not care about their
  club very much.
- The person talking to me sounds really boring. They're so monotone...
- Talks to you briefly but they don't really make eye contact and walks away
  after a while.

**Ideal**

- Give them a warm hello, a smile, and
- They give you a high five when you exit the booth and playfully say, "See you next week Tuesday, right Kevin?"

#### When telling someone about the members' projects

**DO NOT INITIALLY**
- use jargon
- focus on the _language_ or _tools_ you used to build the project
- focus on _how_ the project works
- focus on the fact that _you_ built the project

**DO**
- talk about how you _felt_ when you accomplished the project
- talk about with _who else_ you worked with on your project
- talk about the _setting_ in which you built the project
- was it during club, was it in a class?

If however, you learn during conversation the person you are talking to is
clearly already technical, then you can start using technical terms.

  ```
  Pro-tip:
              __
             / _)
      .-^^^-/ /
   __/       /
   <__.|_|-|_|

  Level up by having a consistent theme for ## you do. That could mean
  your dress, physical materials, to how you interact with anyone will be dinosaur
  themed.

  For example, if everything might be dinosaur themed:

  - everyone would be wearing a dinosaur suit
  - you have dinosaur shaped crackers that you give out
  - there is a dinosaur on your poster
  - you demo a project about dinosaurs
  - etc.
  ```

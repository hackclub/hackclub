Hi {Name},

Because you applied to Hack Camp, I want to invite you to a free workshop on
building your first website that Hack Club (we changed our name from hackEDU) is
running this weekend. Food will be provided :-).

We'll be walking you through building your first website and sending calls and
texts to your phone using code. The workshop is designed for people who have had
no previous coding experience, but early programmers will get something out of
it as well.

We'll be running ten sessions this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Each session
lasts two and a half hours with a 30 minute break and will be hosted in downtown
San Francisco. If you're interested, we'd love for you to register at
https://series.hackclub.io.

If you have any questions, just let me know. You can always call me directly at
{PhoneNumber}.

Happy Hacking!

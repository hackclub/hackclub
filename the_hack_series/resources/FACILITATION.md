### 12:45 : Play Host & Facilitate Conversation

It is your job to be a great host!

- Be a good host by making every participant feel like you were welcoming them like the president!
- It is your job to make sure that everyone talks to everyone else. People will naturally not talk to each other!

**Roles:**

1. **The Front Door Greeter:**
  - Stands by the front door and warmly greets people as they come
  - Gives everyone a sticker
2. **The Guide**
  - Walks hackers from the front door to the hacker space
  - Offers guests water
  - Gives them a brief tour of the Make School and explains briefly what it is
3. **The Conversationalist**
  - Stays in the hacker space and makes sure that there is _always_
    conversation happening between hackers
  - When a new hacker comes up, the conversationalist introduces them to
    someone already there

### 1:10  : Hack Series Introduction & Icebreakers

1. Excitedly welcome everyone to the Hack Series
2. Play the alliterative name game icebreaker standing up.
3. Explain groups and have people count off into groups with a max group size of 4.
  - Emphasize that groups are meant to help each other but not for people to
    be working on the same project together.
4. Introduce the schedule for the day (note that the schedule should already be
   projected on the screen)

### 1:20 : Introduce Part I

2. If you have more experience, feel free to work on your own projects!

  - Send out the https://bit.ly/hackserieshome which links them to the workshop

### 1:25 : Part I: Follow the step-by-step workshop

1. Circle around and make sure everyone has portfolio workshop open
2. Make sure everyone is signed in to JS Bin
3. Instead of asking "How are you doing?" or "Do you need help?" ask "What's
   your progress so far?" or "What do you want to do next?"

Facilitate conversation between hackers.

### 3:00  : Introduce Part II

- Explain that this time is for hackers to customize their website.

- Explain how demos work

### 3:05  : Part II: Customize your website

1. Go around and check in with people for what ideas they're working on
2. Instead of asking "How are you doing?" or "Do you need help?" ask "What's
   your progress so far?" or "What do you want to do next?"

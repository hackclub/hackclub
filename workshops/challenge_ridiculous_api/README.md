# Most Ridiculous API Challenge

_This is an introduction to the [July 2018 challenge](https://hackclub.com/challenge) we ran._

The prompt for this challenge is to create the most ridiculous/dumbest/silliest API possible. An API is a web project that returns a response, usually dependent on some sort of query/input.

For example, you can go to https://api.hackclub.com/v1/challenges to see all of Hack Club’s Challenges.

## Examples

- https://api.github.com/zen – You’ll get a piece of advice. Reload for another randomly-decided line. Does almost nothing.
- http://hypochondriapp.io/ – not an API, but same idea. Get the worst possible disease you could have from a symptom.

The challenge is to create the API, but you are more than welcome to create an application like http://hypochondriapp.io/ that demonstrates your API.

## Getting started

Here are a few tutorials for getting started:

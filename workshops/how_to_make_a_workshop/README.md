# Guidelines for Making a Workshop

**_Note that this is only a preliminary draft of this document:_**

- Go with something working over deriving something from scratch
  - top down (i.e. ionic creator) vs to bottom up (learn the fundamentals of
    javascript or HTML)
- Accessible to beginners to the topic and & people who are newer to the topic
  - Show how to do the thing as quickly as possible
  - Explain them later
- Showing over prefacing
- Shorter over longer
- Smaller chunks over larger chunks
- Modular over linear
  - Reduce the amount of linear time
  - Explicitly communicate and design things so that people can jump around
  - is shippable in ~30ish minutes (all subsequent chunks must be also shippable
    in 30 minutes or less as well)
- Explain only after showing
- Giving them something working over constructing something from scratch
- Choice over forced
  - Buffet styled, give them all of the code at the top
    - They can poke through the code
    - If they don't understand it there's an explanation underneath the phaser
      example
- Is relatable
- TODO
  - This guide needs to have examples of what is good vs what is not good

## Tools

- If you want to make gifs, we suggest using
  [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/). It may look dated, but it does an
  awesome job.
- When writing your workshop locally, use
  [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) to view the workshop exactly as it
  will render on GitHub!

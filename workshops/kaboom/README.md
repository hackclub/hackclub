Kaboom! It's a great word. This is a slides based workshop that you can present at your club. They'll be building a platformer game [(live demo)](https://KaboomDemo.sampoder.repl.co). It is based on the [standard Kaboom intro workshop](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro.md), but has been adapted to be easier and more presentable.

Here are [the slides](https://cloud-4dvtx9tke-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0kaboom__hack_club_workshops_.pdf) [(Google Slides Version)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15KzlltTQm5-AS4ynCMTrInC3zFEFRRIgignGOyl2V4I/edit?usp=sharing) and the [starter template](https://hack.af/mw-game-starter).

Enjoy!

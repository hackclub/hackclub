# Workshops

Welcome to our workshops library, where you'll find all the workshops offered by Hack Club.

Each workshop is around an hour long and walks you through the process of _building something™_ (like a website, app, or game). Our philosophy is that the best way to learn to code is to immediately get your feet wet and build real things (instead of starting out solely learning concepts).

The best way to utilize these workshops is to choose a track, and then set aside a few hours after each workshop to extend what you built (for example, adding multiplayer support to the [Soccer game](soccer/README.md)).

There are two tiers of workshops: _curriculum_ and _sandbox_. Curriculum workshops are ready to be run in club meetings. They have undergone review and testing from community and staff. Sandbox workshops are everything else: from a half-formed idea, to a workshop missing its conclusion. If you're interested in writing or contributing to a workshop, you can get started by checking out [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) -- or ask us in `#meta` on the Slack.

Likewise, if you have any questions or run into any trouble, Slack's the place ([click here](../SLACK.md) for instructions on joining the Slack) :smile:.

## Initial Track

This is our recommended workshop flow. Through it you'll learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through building _real_ things. You'll start off by building your first website and will eventually make your way through the fundamentals of game development.

1. [Preface][preface]: _Have people read this before doing any of the workshops_
2. [Personal Website][personal_website]: _Set up your development tools and build your first website_
3. [Twilio][twilio]: _Use code to call and text your phone_
4. [Soccer][soccer]: _Build your first browser game_
5. [Dodge][dodge]: _Expand upon what you started in Soccer and build your second, more advanced game_
6. [Maze][maze]: _This one's super free-form. Build your third game and thoroughly customize it to truly make it your own._
7. [Ajar.io][ajar]: _Much more advanced and detailed than previous game workshops. Build a single-player clone of https://agar.io/_.

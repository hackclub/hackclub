# Workshops

Welcome to the workshops library.

Hack Club's workshops are built by the community, for the community. If you're interested in writing a new workshop, please email us at workshops@hackclub.com and we'll work with you one-on-one to make it happen.

Each workshop is an hour long and walks you through the process of building something (like a website, app, or game). By the end of each workshop, you'll have a fully functional project online.

Our philosophy that one of the better ways to learn to code is to immediately get your feet wet and build real things. This is how self-taught programmers do it and we want to help you become a self-taught programmer.

Each workshop provides a starting point for a project. For you to learn, you need to go further than just completing the tutorial. You need to tinker. You need to add features. Change features. Break things. As you do this, you'll start to build understanding. There's going to be a lot of Googling, Stack Overflow, and bug fixing.

You're not going to understand many things that the workshops tell you to do. In fact, you're probably not going to understand most of what's happening at first. That's okay. Part of learning to code is learning to cope with not understanding everything that's going on. You'll build understanding over time. The most important thing is to not give up.

There are three tiers of workshops:

- **Core**: Workshops ready to be run in club meetings.
- **Experimental**: Anything in progress: from a half-formed idea, to a workshop missing its conclusion.
- **Retired**: Workshops no longer actively supported by Hack Club and may contain errors, bugs, and monsters.

## Workshop Order

We recommend you run through these workshops first. They are built with total beginners in mind, so don't worry if you haven't coded before.

You'll start off by building your first website and will eventually make your way through the fundamentals of game making.

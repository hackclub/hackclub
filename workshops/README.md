# Workshops

Below is a list of all of our workshops.

Our workshops aim to:

- accommodate beginners and the more experienced.
- allow students to build something fun that they want share with their friends.
- get something shipped as quickly as possible.
- be modular enough that there's no pressure to go through them linearly.
- work well when done in pairs or individually.
- be tinkerable.

We recommend workshops links be provided to club members, with each member
working on the workshops independently and receiving support when needed.

Each workshop is a markdown file and has associated facilitation guidelines.

See our general workshop facilitation guidelines
[here](workshop_details.md#general-workshop-facilitation-guidelines):

Our workshops are free to be used by anyone. If you see any issues,
[make an issue](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/issues/new) or even better
yet, make a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!

If you are working on your own workshop, check out these
[guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TzJLpSV2MWVG3Y8IA1drblu_oQBYOAYcMjMsuNkucp8/edit?usp=sharing).

Unofficial workshops are in the [`contrib`](contrib/) directory.

### Important Note

You will need to obtain and set up a Twilio account before the workshop. Luckily
we have a promotion code that will give you $100 worth of credit. Just follow
the instructions in the
[facilitation guidelines](workshop_details.md#remote-control) for details. Give
yourself at least an hour to do this.

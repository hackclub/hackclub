# Workshops

Welcome to our workshops library, where you'll find all the workshops offered by Hack Club.

Workshops are essentially written lessons that help familiarize you with new tools and concepts.

Each workshop is around an hour long and walks you through the process of _building something™_ (like a website, app, or game). Instead of starting out solely on learning concepts, our philosophy that the best way to learn to code is to immediately get your feet wet and build real things.

Our workshops are a great way to get started! We recommend that you go through these workshops, as well as set aside a few hours after each to further improve what you build -- for example, adding multiplayer support to Soccer game.

There are three tiers of workshops:

- **Core**: Workshops ready to be run in club meetings.
- **Experimental**: Anything in progress: from a half-formed idea, to a workshop missing its conclusion.
- **Retired**: Workshops no longer actively supported by Hack Club and may contain errors, bugs, and monsters.

If you're interested in writing or contributing to a workshop, you can get started by checking out [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) -- or ask us in `#meta` on the Slack.

Likewise, if you have any questions or run into any trouble, please reach out to us in our Slack channel ([click here][slack] for instructions on joining Slack) :smile:.

## Workshop Order

We recommend you run through these workshops first. They are built with total beginners in mind, so don't worry if you haven't coded before.

You'll start off by building your first website and will eventually make your way through the fundamentals of game making.
